Newtonian gravity simulation in Godot. Force calculations are done on the GPU in a compute shader to significantly increase performance.
Around 12,000 particles can be simulated in realtime on an RTX 2060 super.

To play the example scenes, open them in Godot and click the "Run current scene" button or press F6.
